# Setting up
We are going to need a few tools to get going. If you have this setup before camp, that would be great. If not,
don't worry, we will do this in-camp as well if you're having a hard time with it.

# 1) Java 8
Java is what powers Minecraft, and we are going to need the Java Development Kit(JDK) to start working.

# 2) IntelliJ
We will be using the IntelliJ Idea Community Edition software to build our mods. Go to the IntelliJ website
and download and install IntelliJ onto your computer 

# 3) Minecraft Development IntelliJ Plugin
Once you have IntelliJ Idea Community Edition, at the bottom of the panel, go to Configure -> Plugins, then 
search for "Minecraft". Install the Minecraft Development Plugin from inside IntelliJ.

# Notes
- Need Java 8(1.8.0_101 at a minimum). Ran into this earlier.
- Use the project gradlew from the command line to run setupDecompWorkspace

# Links
- Java 8: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html (Scroll Down, get Java SE 8uXXX, where X's
are numbers.)

- IntelliJ Idea Community Edition: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

- Minecraft Development Plugin: No link, do this from within IntelliJ once you have it installed!
